        <h3>Motivation</h3>
        <p>
            As a Penn student, I am often on Path@Penn for one reason or another, whether it be applying for courses or checking my financial aid. However, even as a third year student, Path@Penn is difficult to navigate through, which is why I decided to take up the challenge of redesigning the website.<br>

        <h3>Wireframes</h3>
        <p>
            My main goal when redesigning Path@Penn was to keep it recognizable but make it more intuitive. I was afraid of altering the website too drastically to the point where current users would react negatively towards the changes, as humans are resistant to change.<br>
            <br>
            As a result, I kept a very similar format to the current website. Like the current Path@Penn, I separated resources into categories, confined within rectangular containers, and kept them all on the same page.<br>
            <br>
            However, I changed up the order of the categories, putting the most relevant ones first on the page, to make the website easier for users to navigate through. I also changed the content of Path@Penn’s existing categories, as well as constructed my own categories, to reorganize the resources in a way that would make them easier to sort through.<br>
            <br>
            After reviewing my wireframes, I decided that moving forward I wanted to focus on answering this question: How might we simplify the Path@Penn home page?<br>

        <h3>UI Designs — First Version</h3>
        <p>
            Since I wanted the website to remain recognizable, I selected the same fonts and colors used in the current Path@Penn page. Path@Penn is a product of Penn, so I wanted my redesign to strongly reflect the school’s spirit. I predominantly used Penn’s two official colors—Penn Red and Penn Blue.<br>

        <h3>User Testing</h3>
        <p>
            After finishing my initial designs, I asked one of my academic peers to give me feedback on them. This interviewee was also a female undergraduate Penn student, but she formally studied UX/UI design alongside me. I asked her to perform three key tasks:<br>
            <br>
            * expanding categories<br>
            * visiting the profile page<br>
            * editing content within a category<br>
            <br>
            I instructed her to say the sequences of actions she would perform to complete these three tasks. Her thought processes and hypothetical actions were different from the ones I expected users to have and enact when interacting with Path@Penn.<br>
            <br>
            Afterwards, to get clearer insight into her decisions, I asked her several questions about what she thought would improve the user interaction of the website. From her feedback, I learned that she was unsure which aspects of the website were interactive and what some of the website’s features (e.g., the drop-down arrows, the “edit” button) would even do.
