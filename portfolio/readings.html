            In "Mail Art and the Big Monster", Carrión explains that the importance of Mail Art is its content, rather than how it is delivered, but he also believes that the best Mail Art takes into consideration the Postal Service. He views Mail Art as a form of protest against what he refers to as the "Big Monster", however he is unsure of exactly what or whom he's referring to. Although, what is clear is that the "Big Monster" is related to the Postal Service, either directly or abstractly. Carrión asserts that the reproduction and/or sharing of Mail Art bothers the "Big Monster," and therefore people reacting and responding to Mail Art is "the only thing that really counts". <br>
            <br>
            1. What do you consider to be the "Big Monster" that Carrión mentions in the text?<br>
            2. Why does Mail Art harm the "Big Monster"?

            In Laurel Schwulst's essay, she stressed that the future of the web depends on artists creating their own websites. Schwulst mentioned how websites owned by corporations—such as Facebook, Instagram, and Pinterest—prioritized advertising over their users' needs and that artists creating websites would be a way to protect themselves and others from those corporate-owned websites. She listed metaphors to describe many different ways artists could use or treat their websites, expressing the vast possibilities gained from making websites.
            In Édouard U.'s essay, he talked about the importance of consuming media meaningfully, specifically by consuming media of the same or different types at once. For example, U. talked about his habit of co-reading books and suggested mixing different sounds and styles together when listening to music. By doing things like watching a film while reading its Wikipedia page, people are engaging with the content they're consuming past the surface level and making their own connections and critical observations.
            The reading this week being two essays goes back to U.'s point about using two works/pieces of media to think critically. Here, I will try to explain a connection I made between both essays. U. wrote that there are relationships to be found between different pieces of media, and Schwulst wrote that a website is an individual act of collective ambition. Both essays contain the idea that, as U. stated, "Nothing exists in isolation."<br>
            <br>
            1. What are some other metaphors for what a website can be?<br>
            2. Do you agree with Schwulst's opinion that artists creating websites will help save the future of the internet and the web? What are other ways that you think will help?

            In "Still There", Olia Lialina discusses how influential Geocities was and still is. She talks about how before Geocities ceased to exist, a group of people called the Archive Team managed to save approximately a terabyte of data. From that data, from observing many archived Geocities pages, she was able to find website trends that must've been common in the 90s. Another thing she discovered was that some remnants of Geocities are still on the internet, such as: www.geocities.com/clipart/pbi/backgrounds/ and http://geocities.co.jp. However, when I tried looking up those websites myself, the first link sent me to Yahoo! and the second link could not be reached. Although sad that another part of Geocities has disappeared, it also speaks to Lialina's message that all web pages die eventually as the web continues to rapidly evolve.<br>
            <br>
            1. What are some websites from the 2000s-2010s that you recall having been taken down?<br>
            2. What is one website active right now that you think would have the closest impact to Geocities' "death" if it also shut down?

            In Selections from A *New* Program for Graphic Design, Reinfurt discussed the importance of Gestalt psychology to graphic design. Reinfurt provided many examples from both the far past and contemporary times to support his point. For example, he mentioned the wait cursor's design change from a wristwatch to the "spinning beach ball of death." Hearing this, I thought it seemed odd to replace a simple watch cursor with a spinning color wheel since it has almost nothing to do with waiting. However, due to the power of the Gestalt principle of Past Experience (context and repetition), it has become an extremely recognizable graphic idea. Using Gestalt psychology, designers have been able to create famous and widely known icons and logos, as well as do many other things like forming solutions for television broadcastings. With knowledge of Gestalt principles, the possibilities are endless.<br>
            <br>
            1. How do you apply your knowledge of Gestalt principles to your designs?<br>
            2. Which of Reinfurt's examples was the most shocking and/or impressive to you? Why?

            In Post-Digital Print, Ludovico and Cramer discuss the importance of spreading hybrid (digital and print) publications. Ludovico talks about how many traditional print products are now considered vintage and therefore are also now considered valuable objects. However, at the same time, this also means that there is a dwindling customer base for them. Ludovico believes that print should therefore adapt some digital aspects to appeal to greater audiences, such as including mechanisms that are able to initiate social or media processes. He also believes that digital networking technologies should make better use of print to become more creative and be respectful of print's cultural significance. Ludovico advocates for more hybrids between digital and print publications, even suggesting adding QR codes within the pages of printed books and magazines as a means of providing new updates. Cramer supports Ludovico's ideas, stating that there are many limitations and frustrations felt when interacting with separate digital and print publications. Instead of ignoring the past (print) or resenting the present (digital), hybrid publications allows for the best parts of both digital and print.<br>
            <br>
            1. What are some hybrid publications that you've seen and enjoy?<br>
            2. Do you agree with Ludovico and Cramer's points about hybrid publications, or do you think there are some benefits to keeping (some) digital and physical publications separate?

            Coklyat and Finnegan discuss alt-text and how to use it creatively while also maintaining its accessibility. Coklyat and Finnegan believe that alt-text poetry is only meaningful if it makes the internet more accessible, as increasing and/or maintaining accessibility is alt-text's main function. They also presented helpful advice on how to write alt-text poetry to be accessible. Coklyat and Finnegan push for alt-text to be written poetically, rather than objectively, since alt-text written objectively don't capture the tone of images and can actually be even more difficult to understand. Coklyat and Finnegan feel that bringing an artistic perspective to alt-text can help make it feel more like an integral part of the whole work rather than simply an add-on.<br>
            <br>
            1. Other than adding alt-text, what are other ways you can think of to make a website more accessible?<br>
            2. Do you agree with Coklyat and Finnegan's belief that there room for creativity when writing alt-text or do you think alt-text should be written as objectively as possible?

            Nasser speaks about how there is a very obvious linguistic bias within digital/computing tools and programs. For example, programming languages, such as Python, are created with English in mind only and offers no localization. Nasser discusses the obvious bias towards the English written language and how that puts many people who aren’t proficient at English at a huge disadvantage. Nasser even attempted to create his own coding language that solely used Arabic (his native language), but the fact that English names are so ingrained in the world of software made his project doomed to fail. Not using English separated the project from that world, and programming is and should always be a social and collaborative act. Nasser believes that the inclusion of non-English programming will probably not happen for years or maybe even ever. As he states it, "The door to a non-English programming experience is closed now, [...] and as time passes and more software gets written, it closes tighter still." However, he remains some hope, as he talks about different potential solutions to combat this widespread bias towards the English written language.<br>
            <br>
            1. Prior to the reading, did you ever think about how programming languages were designed biased towards English? How did becoming aware of about this bias impact your opinion of programming?<br>
            2. Do you think a non-English programming language can naturally emerge? If so, do you think it would be able to prosper alongside other programming languages, which are all English-based?

            Duvall begins by saying that graphic design is made up of two parts: the surface and the sign. However, the way that these two parts were used changed as time went on and will continue to change. As Duvall said, with the existence of the internet, surface has become infinite and free. The surface has become a sign in and of itself, with the sign often taking the form of a hyperlink. Duvall uses the icons and typography of Disney to show the shift from Modernism to Hypermodernism.<br>
            <br>
            1. What are other examples of Hypermodern signifiers that you can think of?<br>
            2. What do you think the next stage of graphic design could potentially look like (after Hypermodernism)?

            In this reading, Tuer discusses two of Vera Frenkel's new media art: String Games and Body Missing. Tuer focuses on String Games for the majority of this reading, discussing what it is, Frenkel’s intent while making it, and its impact (or rather, initial lack thereof). Tuer brought up how despite it being groundbreaking, String Games didn’t receive recognition until nearly thirty years after its first installation and presented various possible reasons as to why that happened. Then, Tuer mentions Body Missing and, like she did for String Games, discussed what it was and Frenkel’s intent with it. Tuer briefly talks about the connections between Body Missing and String Games. Tuer says that it is only by juxtaposing the two that Frenkel’s use of technology “as a certain way to do things” emerges as one that probes the liminality of the image in warding off oblivion. Through these two works, Frenkel alerts her audience to the function of the “ever-present phantasmagoric” screen as an agent of disappearance. They are both part of Frenkel’s quest to explore how memory is shaped by the transmission and circulation of images in the electronic age.<br>
            <br>
            1. Which of the two works (Body Missing and String Games) conveyed loss better to you?<br>
            2. Are there any other factors that you think could’ve led to String Games not receiving the recognition it deserved for almost 30 years?<br>
            3. Is there another piece of art that you know of that shares the same themes of Body Missing and/or String Games? If so, what is it?

            Soulellis starts by talking about posts—the origin of the post, what purpose they are used for, and how they have changed between pre-network to post-network. Soulellis then starts comparing posts to “feeds”, which unlike posts are not a singular act but a continuous transmission. Like he did with the post, he also discusses the history of the feed. Soulellis talks about how the limitless of the feed fuels our addiction to social media and encourages us to keep engaging with non-human voices (bots). These are two big problems caused by the feed, and Soulellis suggests ways to combat them. He suggests archiving (e.g. printing bots) as a form of resistance against bots and leaking information as a form of resistance against the feed. Soulellis believes that the feed has not entirely replaced the post yet and there are some actions needed to prevent that from happening, such as resisting the new boredom and modulating between fixed and flowing information.<br>
            <br>
            1. Can you think of other ways to combat the feed and try to bring back the post?<br>
            2. Do you think there is any relevance to bring back the post or should we embrace the feed?<br>
            3. Do you think it is possible to even draw the majority of people’s attentions to the post again?

            In Beyond Dark Matter, Gem learns about how the history of technology is steeped in racial prejudice and, due to it primarily being used to target Black people in the past, still has some of that prejudice today. Before encountering The Way, Gem was ignorant of this history and accepted the current state of technology as it was, despite feeling uncomfortable about some aspects, such as the technical terms "master" and "slave", because that was how it's always been. After being encountering The Way and realizing that she has no power or control in The Way, she escapes to The Beyond, where she realizes that her computer does not define her and that change is possible. When Gem leaves her The Beyond, she decides to become more involved within her local community.<br>
            <br>
            1. Do you think it is possible for The Way to eventually disappear (i.e. do you think the racial prejudice engrained into technology can eventually disappear)?<br>
            2. Did this story help you gain hope for the future (listening to The Beyond) or are you still pessimistic about the future of technology / computers (following The Way)?

            In "Art on the Internet", Groys discusses how the Internet has altered the nature of art and literature. He says that, due to the Internet being an free space with no real walls to separate or categorize what is on it, the use of the Internet as the main medium of production and distribution of art and literature will lead to their defictionalization. Groys even goes as far as arguing that on the Internet there is no art or literature, but only information about them. He asserts that we are not dealing with art or literature on the Internet but with data design. Groys further discusses the dangers of the Internet, such as how every action—even moments of contemplation—are traceable, destroying the autonomy of the user or content creator. However, Groys ends on a more light-hearted note by mentioning the positive implications of using the Internet as an art archive, saying that it may possibly lead to decontextualization and recontextualization through the "cut-and-paste" operations the Internet offers, which strengthens the archive's utopian premise and weakens its potential for betraying it.<br>
            <br>
            1. Do you agree with Groys' argument that on the Internet there is no art or literature?<br>
            2. If you can think of any, other than using the Internet as an archive, what are some other ways putting art and literature on the Internet can be beneficial?
