            In "Mail Art and the Big Monster", Carrión explains that the importance of Mail Art is its content, rather than how it is delivered, but he also believes that the best Mail Art takes into consideration the Postal Service. He views Mail Art as a form of protest against what he refers to as the "Big Monster", however he is unsure of exactly what or whom he's referring to. Although, what is clear is that the "Big Monster" is related to the Postal Service, either directly or abstractly. Carrión asserts that the reproduction and/or sharing of Mail Art bothers the "Big Monster," and therefore people reacting and responding to Mail Art is "the only thing that really counts". <br>
            <br>
            What do you consider to be the "Big Monster" that Carrión mentions in the text? Why does Mail Art harm the "Big Monster"?

            In Laurel Schwulst's essay, she stressed that the future of the web depends on artists creating their own websites. Schwulst mentioned how websites owned by corporations—such as Facebook, Instagram, and Pinterest—prioritized advertising over their users' needs and that artists creating websites would be a way to protect themselves and others from those corporate-owned websites. She listed metaphors to describe many different ways artists could use or treat their websites, expressing the vast possibilities gained from making websites.
            In Édouard U.'s essay, he talked about the importance of consuming media meaningfully, specifically by consuming media of the same or different types at once. For example, U. talked about his habit of co-reading books and suggested mixing different sounds and styles together when listening to music. By doing things like watching a film while reading its Wikipedia page, people are engaging with the content they're consuming past the surface level and making their own connections and critical observations.
            The reading this week being two essays goes back to U.'s point about using two works/pieces of media to think critically. Here, I will try to explain a connection I made between both essays. U. wrote that there are relationships to be found between different pieces of media, and Schwulst wrote that a website is an individual act of collective ambition. Both essays contain the idea that, as U. stated, "Nothing exists in isolation."<br>
            <br>
            What are some other metaphors for what a website can be?
            Do you agree with Schwulst's opinion that artists creating websites will help save the future of the internet and the web? What are other ways that you think will help?
